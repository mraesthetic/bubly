You are editing reel strips for my slot game.
The current CSV is VALID and must be treated as the baseline math.
Rules:

The CSV has 6 reels (columns) and 258 rows (stops) per reel.

Never change the number of reels or the number of rows.

Never introduce new symbols. Allowed symbols: H1,H2,H3,H4,L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,S,BS.

Only change what I explicitly ask you to change.

When editing, keep per-reel symbol counts close to the original (no symbol may change by more than N copies unless I say so).

Preserve the rows that contain only L5 or only S unless I explicitly allow changing them.

Output the entire updated CSV when done, but only with the requested local modifications.
